# **DATA VISUALIZATION LIBRARIES**

Here are awesome Python libraries for data visualization.

**Matplotlib**- Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. This is a library for two-dimensional plotting with Python.

**Seaborn** - Seaborn aims to make visualization a central part of exploring and understanding data. 
It has the potential to deliver accurate graphs such as heat maps.

**Plotly** - plotly is an interactive, open-source, and browser-based graphing library for Python. It is a high-level, declarative charting library.

**dtreeviz** - Decision tree visualization and model interpretation.

**ipyvolume** - 3d plotting for Python in the Jupyter notebook based on IPython widgets using WebGL.

**NuPIC Studio** -An all-in-one NuPIC Hierarchical Temporal Memory visualization and debugging super-tool

**PyQtGraph** - A pure-python graphics and GUI library built on PyQt4 / PySide and NumPy.

**bqplot** - An API for plotting in Jupyter (IPython).

**Bokeh** - Bokeh strength lies in the ability to create interactive, web-ready plots, which can be easily output as, HTML documents, JSON objects, or interactive web applications. It also supports streaming & real-time data.

**Pydot**

Pydot is a library for generating complex oriented and non-oriented graphs. To show the structure of graphs, which are very often needed when building neural networks and decision trees based algorithms.

**pygal** - A Python SVG Charts Creator.

**vispy** - GPU-based high-performance interactive OpenGL 2D/3D data visualization library.

**cerebro2** - A web-based visualization and debugging platform for NuPIC.

**mizani** - scales package.

**bqplot** - Plotting library for IPython/Jupyter Notebooks.

**PtitPrince** - Raindrop cloud.

**joypy** - Ridgeline plots.

**networkx** -NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.

**plotnine** - plotnine is an implementation of a grammar of graphics in Python, it is based on ggplot2.

**Altair** - Altair is a declarative statistical visualization library for Python.  Altair is a grammar-based visualization library. With Altair, you can spend more time understanding your data and its meaning. 

**Autoviz** - AutoViz performs automatic visualization of any dataset with a single line of Python code. Give it any input file (CSV, txt, or json) of any size, and AutoViz will visualize it. 

**Igraph** - binding to igraph library - General purpose graph library.

**d3py** - A plotting library for Python, based on D3.js.

**ggplot** - Same API as ggplot2 for R.

**ggfortify** - Unified interface to ggplot2 popular R packages.

**Kartograph.py** - Rendering beautiful SVG maps in Python.

**Yellowbrick** - Yellowbrick is an open-source, pure Python project that extends the scikit-learn API with visual analysis and diagnostic tools. For users, Yellowbrick can help evaluate the performance, stability, and predictive value of machine learning models.

**pastalog** - Simple, realtime visualization of neural network training performance.

**visualize_ML** - A python package for data exploration and data analysis.

**scikit-plot** - A visualization library for quick and easy generation of common plots in data analysis and machine learning.

**Bowtie** - A dashboard library for interactive visualizations using flask socketio and react.
