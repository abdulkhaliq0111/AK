# **COMPUTER VISION**

Here are useful Python libraries for Computer Vision.

[Scikit-Image](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image) - A collection of algorithms for image processing in Python.

[SimpleCV](http://simplecv.org) - An open-source computer vision framework that gives access to several high-powered computer vision libraries, such as OpenCV. Written on Python and runs on Mac, Windows, and Ubuntu Linux.

[Vigranumpy](https://github.com/ukoethe/vigra) - Python bindings for the VIGRA C++ computer vision library.

[imgaug](https://github.com/aleju/imgaug) - Image augmentation for machine learning experiments.

[imutils](https://github.com/jrosebr1/imutils) - A library containing Convenience functions to make basic image processing operations such as translation, rotation, resizing, skeletonization, and displaying Matplotlib images easier with OpenCV and Python.

[imgaug_extension](https://github.com/cadenai/imgaug_extension) - Additional augmentations for imgaug.

[pytessarct](https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract) - Python-tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool for python. That is, it will recognize and "read" the text embedded in images. Python-tesseract is a wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine>.

[Augmentor](https://github.com/mdbloice/Augmentor) - Image augmentation library in Python for machine learning.

[OpenFace](https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/) - Free and open source face recognition with deep neural networks.

[opencv](https://opencv.org/) - OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. OpenCV is a highly optimized library with a focus on real-time applications.

[PCV]() - Open source Python module for computer vision. [Deprecated]

[face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) - Face recognition library that recognizes and manipulate faces from Python or the command line.

[dockerface](https://github.com/natanielruiz/dockerface) - Easy to install and use deep learning Faster R-CNN face detection for images and video in a docker container.

[Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron) - FAIR's software system that implements state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, including Mask R-CNN. It is written in Python and powered by the Caffe2 deep learning framework.

[PyTorchCV](https://github.com/donnyyou/PyTorchCV) - A PyTorch-Based Framework for Deep Learning in Computer Vision.

[neural-style-pt](https://github.com/ProGamerGov/neural-style-pt) - A PyTorch implementation of Justin Johnson's neural-style (neural style transfer).

[detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)- FAIR's next-generation research platform for object detection and segmentation. It is a ground-up rewrite of the previous version, Detectron, and is powered by the PyTorch deep learning framework.

[Detecto](https://github.com/alankbi/detecto) - Train and run a computer vision model with 5-10 lines of code.

[neural-dream](https://github.com/ProGamerGov/neural-dream) - A PyTorch implementation of DeepDream.

**pillow** - Python Imaging Library is a free and open-source additional library for the Python programming language that adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.

**mahouts** - Mahotas is a library of fast computer vision algorithms (all implemented in C++ for speed) operating over NumPy arrays.

[albumentations](https://github.com/albu/albumentations) - –ê fast and framework agnostic image augmentation library that implements a diverse set of augmentation techniques. Supports classification, segmentation, detection out of the box. I was used to winning several Deep Learning competitions at Kaggle, Topcoder, and those that were a part of the CVPR workshops.
