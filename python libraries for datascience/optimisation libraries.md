# OPTIMISATION LIBRARIES

Here are useful Python libraries for Optimising tasks.

* [Bayesian Optimization](https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization) - A Python implementation of global optimization with gaussian processes.

* [SafeOpt](https://github.com/befelix/SafeOpt) - Safe Bayesian Optimization.The code can be used to automatically optimize performance measures subject to a safety constraint by adapting parameters. 

* [scikit-optimize](https://github.com/scikit-optimize/scikit-optimize) - Sequential model-based optimization with a `scipy.optimize` interface.
* [Solid](https://github.com/100/Solid) - A comprehensive gradient-free optimization framework written in Python.

* [PySwarms](https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/pyswarms) - A research toolkit for particle swarm optimization in Python.

* [Spearmint](https://github.com/HIPS/Spearmint) - spearmint is a package to perform Bayesian optimization according to the algorithms outlined in the paper: Practical Bayesian Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms.

* [BoTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/botorch) -BoTorch (pronounced like "blow-torch") is a library for Bayesian Optimization research built on top of PyTorch, and is part of the PyTorch ecosystem.

* [hyperopt-sklearn](https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt-sklearn) - Hyper-parameter optimization for sklearn. 

* [sklearn-deap](https://github.com/rsteca/sklearn-deap) - Use evolutionary algorithms instead of gridsearch in scikit-learn.
