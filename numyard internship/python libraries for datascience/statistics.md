# Statistics

Here are useful Python libraries for statistics.

* [pandas_summary](https://github.com/mouradmourafiq/pandas-summary) - Extension to pandas dataframes describe function. The DataFrameSummary expect a pandas DataFrame to summarise. 

* [Pandas Profiling](https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling) - Create HTML profiling reports from pandas DataFrame objects.pandas_profiling extends the pandas DataFrame with df.profile_report() for quick data analysis.

* [statsmodels](https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels) - statsmodels is a Python package that provides a complement to scipy for statistical computations including descriptive statistics and estimation and inference for statistical models.

* [scikit-posthocs](https://github.com/maximtrp/scikit-posthocs) - Pairwise Multiple Comparisons Post-hoc Tests.This package will be useful for statisticians, data analysts, and researchers who use Python in their work.

* [Alphalens](https://github.com/quantopian/alphalens) -Alphalens is a Python Library for performance analysis of predictive (alpha) stock factors. Alphalens works great with the Zipline open source backtesting library, and Pyfolio which provides performance and risk analysis of financial portfolios.

* [adaptive](https://github.com/python-adaptive/adaptive) - Tools for adaptive and parallel samping of mathematical functions.

* [stockstats](https://github.com/jealous/stockstats) - Supply a wrapper ``StockDataFrame`` based on the ``pandas.DataFrame`` with inline stock statistics/indicators support.

* [recmetrics](https://github.com/statisticianinstilettos/recmetrics) - Library of useful metrics and plots for evaluating recommender systems.

* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) - The fundamental package needed for scientific computing with Python.

* [Dask](https://github.com/dask/dask) - Parallel computing with task scheduling. Dask provides advanced parallelism for analytics, enabling performance at scale for the tools you love

* [bottleneck](https://github.com/kwgoodman/bottleneck) - Fast NumPy array functions written in C.Bottleneck strives to be a drop-in accelerator for NumPy functions.

* [CuPy](https://github.com/cupy/cupy) - CuPy is an implementation of NumPy-compatible multi-dimensional array on CUDA. CuPy consists of the core multi-dimensional array class, cupy.ndarray, and many functions on it. It supports a subset of the NumPy.ndarray interface.

* [scikit-tensor](https://github.com/mnick/scikit-tensor) - Python library for multilinear algebra and tensor 
factorizations.

* [numdifftools](https://github.com/pbrod/numdifftools) - Solve automatic numerical differentiation problems in one or more variables.

* [quaternion](https://github.com/moble/quaternion) - Add built-in support for quaternions to NumPy.This package creates a quaternion type in python and further enables NumPy to create and manipulate arrays of quaternions. 

* [AI Fairness 360](https://github.com/IBM/AIF360) - Fairness metrics for datasets and ML models, explanations, and algorithms to mitigate bias in datasets and models.

* [weightedcalcs](https://github.com/jsvine/weightedcalcs) - A pandas-based utility to calculate weighted means, medians, distributions, standard deviations, and more.

* [sklearn-evaluation](https://github.com/edublancas/sklearn-evaluation) - Model evaluation made easy: plots, tables and markdown reports.
