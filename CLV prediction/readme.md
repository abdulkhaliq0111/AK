# INTRODUCTION

# GENERAL OVERVIEW:
Customer Life Time Value is the net profit attributed to the company for a certain amount
of period by the customer. There are two ways to grow bussiness, The first to acquire new
customers and The second is to focus on retaining existing clients and increasing their
lifetime value. Retaining the customers is the main focus of the companies now a days as
high CLV brings in high revenue from each customer, it means the company can afford to
spend more to acquire new clients and retain the existing ones.It’s solution involves
analysing the data,possible prediction of the CLV.

# DATA:
● Data available for training this model comprised of data of different customers who
took different policies.

● The data includes customers who took insurance policies on various vehicle classes
such as SUV,sports car etc and their corresponding monthly policy details like
monthly premium auto etc and thier total claim amount.

● There was no missing data in the training set or the test set, thus simplifying the
overall pre-processing.

● CLV :Net profit attributed to the company for a certain
amount of period by the customer.

● Coverage :Amount of risk or liability that is covered for an
idividual by way of insurance services.

● Monthly Premium Auto :The amount you pay for the insurance company on
a monthly basis.

● Months since Policy Inception :No.of months since the start of the insurance
policy.

● Sales Channel :The modes by which the company brings the
policies to the customers.

● Months since Last claim :No.of months since the customer claimed the last
policy.

● Total Claim Amount :The sum payable at the end of the policy(/when
claimed by company to the customer.

# TARGET:
The target variables are,

1. Making a good estimate of Customer Life Time Value (CLV) and stating CLV as a
periodic value

2. Predicting the type of customers that would generally give the company more
revenue

# PRE PROCESSING

Here we used some of the imported libraries Numpy ,Pandas ,MatplotLib ,Seaborn,
Sklearn.

# FEATURE SELECTION:

❖ Firstly we removed the features ‘ Customer ’ and ‘Effective to Date ’ because of the
insignificance in the prediction of the CLV .

❖ From the remaining features we formed a hypothesis that the following feautures
were more significant.

➢ Monthly Premium Auto

➢ Total Claim Amount

➢ Policy

➢ Policy Type

➢ Location Code

# CO-RELATIONS:

Firstly, we plotted a Heat map to get a co-relation between the feautures.

# FEAUTURE INTERPRETATION
MINIMIZING VARIABLES:

● By observing the Heat Map , we noticed some of feautures have a very less
corelations with each other.So,we removed the feautures :’Education’ ,’ State’ , ’
Number of Open Complaints’, ’Vehicle Size’, ‘Months Since Policy Inception’.

● We also removed the feauture ‘Employment Status’ as Unemployment is the major
part in Employment Status which is also covered in ‘Income’ feauture.

# STRATIFIED SHUFFLE-SPLIT:

● To split dataset into train set and test set,we used stratified shuffle-split function
from scikit-learn imported library .

● This cross-validation object is a merge of StratifiedKFold and ShuffleSplit, which
returns stratified randomized folds.

● The folds are made by preserving the percentage of samples for each class.

● We shuffle-split basis on ‘Response’ to get equal percentages in both the train and
test set to train accurately.

# MODEL SELECTION
## LINEAR REGRESSION:
● Initial intuition behind using Linear Regression was the conditional independence
of the available feautures.

● From this we found the coefficients of the feautures ,from where we can know the
dependency of each feautures.

● R^2(R Square) value obtained : 0.1858

● Standard Deviation of Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) : 295.7399

● Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) : 59.2176

## DECISION TREE:

● This model will provide an effective method of Decision Making since,they allow us
to analyze fully the possible consequences of a decision.

● It provides us a framework to quantify the values of outcomes and the probablities
of achieving them.

● R^2(R Square) value obtained : 0.4988

● Standard Deviation of Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) : 387.70

● Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) : 12.9891
